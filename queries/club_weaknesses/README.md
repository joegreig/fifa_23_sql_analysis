### Club Weaknesses

In the initial query, the first Common Table Expression (CTE) named `target_club` was utilized to select the desired club and compute the mean values of overall rating, market value, and age for its players.

```postgresql
SELECT 
    club_name,
    ROUND(AVG(overall), 1) AS average_overall, 
    ROUND(AVG(value / 1000000), 1) AS average_value_millions,
    ROUND(AVG(age), 1) AS average_age
FROM players 
WHERE club_name = 'Real Madrid CF'
GROUP BY club_name 
```

| club_name      | average_overall | average_value_millions | average_age |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Real Madrid CF | 83.9            | 49.3                   | 27.5        |



In the subsequent CTE, `average_by_position`, the average rating for each playing position within the club was computed by employing the GROUP BY clause.

```postgresql
SELECT 
    players.club_name, 
    position_type,
    position, 
    ROUND(AVG(overall), 1) AS average_overall
FROM players 
JOIN target_club USING (club_name)
GROUP BY position, position_type, players.club_name
```

| club_name      | position_type | position | average_overall |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Real Madrid CF | Midfielder    | CM       | 84.3            |
| Real Madrid CF | Defender      | LB       | 83              |
| Real Madrid CF | Defender      | RB       | 82.5            |
| Real Madrid CF | Defender      | RWB      | 78              |
| Real Madrid CF | Midfielder    | RM       | 81              |
| Real Madrid CF | Forward       | LW       | 85              |
| Real Madrid CF | Forward       | CF       | 91              |
| Real Madrid CF | Midfielder    | CDM      | 80.5            |
| Real Madrid CF | Forward       | RW       | 83              |
| Real Madrid CF | Defender      | CB       | 84.8            |
| Real Madrid CF | Goalkeeper    | GK       | 90              |



The ultimate CTE, `club_weaknesses`, was implemented to identify the positions that displayed subpar overall ratings in comparison to the club's average.

```postgresql
SELECT 
    position_type, 
    position, 
    abp.average_overall AS position_average, 
    tc.average_overall, 
    abp.club_name
FROM average_by_position abp
JOIN target_club tc USING (club_name)
WHERE abp.average_overall < tc.average_overall
ORDER BY position_type
```

| position_type | position | position_average | average_overall | club_name      |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Defender      | LB       | 83               | 83.9            | Real Madrid CF |
| Defender      | RB       | 82.5             | 83.9            | Real Madrid CF |
| Defender      | RWB      | 78               | 83.9            | Real Madrid CF |
| Forward       | RW       | 83               | 83.9            | Real Madrid CF |
| Midfielder    | RM       | 81               | 83.9            | Real Madrid CF |
| Midfielder    | CDM      | 80.5             | 83.9            | Real Madrid CF |



The final query aimed to identify players who fulfilled the following criteria: played in the positions of weakness, possessed an age lower than the club's average age, had a market value below the club's average value, and displayed an overall rating higher than the club's average overall rating.

```postgresql
SELECT 
    name, 
    (value / 1000000) AS value_millions, 
    position_type, 
    position, 
    overall, 
    potential
FROM players 
WHERE age < (SELECT average_age FROM target_club) 
    AND (value / 1000000) < (SELECT average_value_millions FROM target_club)
    AND overall > (SELECT average_overall FROM target_club)
    AND club_name != 'Real Madrid CF'
ORDER BY position_type, position
```

| name            | value_millions | position_type | position | overall | potential |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------- | --------- |
| W. Ndidi        | 47             | Defender      | CB       | 84      | 86        |
